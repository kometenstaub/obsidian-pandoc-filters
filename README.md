# Pandoc Filters and Workflow for Obsidian

> [!NOTE] Note
> - This workflow focuses on `markdown -> latex -> pdf`. There are many great plugins for other pipelines, like [Obsidian Webpage Export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export).

Imagine your professor gives you a LaTeX template and asks you to scribe a lecture note, while you have already taken the note in Obsidian with handy features like [callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts) and [block links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Link+to+a+block+in+a+note), and even advanced plugins like [pseudocode](https://github.com/ytliu74/obsidian-pseudocode) and [TikZ](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-tikzjax). Spend another year to type it again or do some tedious manual conversion? ðŸ˜© Never! With one command within Obsidian and you are ready to submit! ðŸ¥³
